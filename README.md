This is a fast deep learning framework in C built from scratch for hardware performance benchmarking or simple machine learning tasks requiring efficiently configurable and deployable deep neural networks.

The default program in **main.c** reports timing for model initialization, forward passing, and backward passing of a network with over 1 billion parameters. To compile and execute this program, simply use the terminal commands shown below. Use the same commands if modifications are made in **main.c** for other use.

```
cd build
make && ./exec
```
